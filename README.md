  "Alter" / "Alterrant", the Valorant cheat currently for sale for $50 United States Dollars per month ðŸ˜‚
</p>

Created originally by 'HellSec' and backed by 'BirdLinux', this cheat is a fully fledged waste of disk space and will help you in no way whilst playing any games. Claimed by the developers ([HellSec](https://github.com/rpie) & [BirdLinux](https://github.com/deidal0s)) to have many upcoming features such as aimbot (upcoming because they haven't pasted it yet)

I will continue to update this source as time goes on, adding features for anyone who actually wants to use this LOL.

### Features
```diff
v1.?.? official release
+ Box ESP
+ Corner ESP
+ Tracers
+ Healthbar ESP
+ Distance calculator (x no. of metres)
+ Watermark (Drawing image on screen)
+ Crosshair (Drawing image on screen)
```
As you can tell, they have limited features that aren't worth ***50 dollars*** a month.

### Seems familiar: https://github.com/kenn-notation/Valorant-External

As you can tell, it is still being pasted by the devs (nothing new, they previously tried to steal and paste my Discord exploit [Otax](https://github.com/0x44F/Otax)) do not expect this 'cheat' to do anything at all, its just a fake loader and the cheat itself is actually just pasted trash that is 100% detected.

**Do not buy this fake cheat. It is a literal scam**

## Updated screenshots

Alter / Alterrant received a menu overhaul which looks like a generic ImGui menu. Obviously they are still using the same source code just
with a changed menu and brand new **pasted aimbot**.

## Background
BirdLinux is known by many to be a huge skid, so is HellSec and neither of them can hack, would you really trust these two buffoons to make a fully-fledged cheat for Valorant that evades Vanguard detection? Didn't think so.

### BirdLinux
Discord ID 991363469876146216 or birdlinux#6722 is a known skid. He goes by many aliases but the current ones are "BirdLinux" and "deidal0s". He has never
made anything original and usually resorts to pasting from public GitHub pages.

### HellSec
HellSec is known by many to be a pathological liar and cheat. He has never really made any true contributions and only pretends he has knowledge of anything.
Do not trust this guy to perform even the most simple of tasks, he will fail. He would probably be a really good poker player as he is a great bluffer and honestly a piece of shit.

## Notes
Added cheat source for what was previously their cheat, they have now changed only the menu and added a few pasted or simple features such as aimbot and watermarks. Looking in their Discord chat shows a user asking about their cheat looking the exact same and their excuse is 'it was for testing' and 'the menu is all we stole'. *Ask yourself this: why would a great cheat developer ever have a need to steal such a simple menu?*
