As you can tell, it is still being pasted by the devs (nothing new, they previously tried to steal and paste my Discord exploit [Otax](https://github.com/0x44F/Otax)) do not expect this 'cheat' to do anything at all, its just a fake loader and the cheat itself is actually just pasted trash that is 100% detected.

**Do not buy this fake cheat. It is a literal scam**

## Background
BirdLinux is known by many to be a huge skid, so is HellSec and neither of them can hack, would you really trust these two buffoons to make a fully-fledged cheat for Valorant that evades Vanguard detection? Didn't think so.

### BirdLinux
Discord ID 991363469876146216 or birdlinux#6722 is a known skid. He goes by many aliases but the current ones are "BirdLinux" and "deidal0s". He has never
made anything original and usually resorts to pasting from public GitHub pages.

### HellSec
HellSec is known by many to be a pathological liar and cheat. He has never really made any true contributions and only pretends he has knowledge of anything.
Do not trust this guy to perform even the most simple of tasks, he will fail. He would probably be a really good poker player as he is a great bluffer and honestly a piece of shit.
